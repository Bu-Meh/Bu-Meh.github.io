                <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in education technology. AI helps gather data to guide instruction and accelerates learner growth by adapting to individual student needs.</p>
                <p>However, that also takes away intelligence. Student will never be able to learn if all they know is taking short cut and knowing that they don't have to try. </p>
                <p> AI in a ways is helpful. AI allows teachers to automate tasks like grading fill-in-the-blank and multiple-choice questions, tutors can support students by providing feedback and monitoring their progress in real-time. </p>
