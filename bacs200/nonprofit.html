         <h2>Our Mission</h2>
         <p>The Soccer Without Borders mission is to use soccer as a vehicle for positive change, providing under-served youth with a toolkit to overcome obstacles to growth, inclusion, and personal success.</p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Our Values</strong></li>
            <li>AUTHENTICITY - When building an SWB program, we value all voices, particularly those of youth and members of the communities we serve.</li>
            <li>WHOLE PERSON - We believe in a whole-person approach to youth development. Our programs help young people come into a greater understanding of their bodies, minds, and voices.</li>
            <li>PROCESS-ORIENTED - We believe in the learning that comes from a quality process that focuses on what is within our control: creating a culture of acceptance, addressing obstacles to an inclusive environment, and supporting progress toward individual, team and community goals.</li>
            <li>EQUITY - We aim to advance equity in ourselves, our structures, our systems, our partners, and our communities. We value and seek best practices for equitable access and opportunities, investment, representation, power, and voice.</li>
