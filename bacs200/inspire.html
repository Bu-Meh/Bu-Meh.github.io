            <p> RBG was an American lawyer and servered as a judge on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death in 2020. </p>

            <h1> Some of my favorite Quotes By RBG </h1>
            <p> <strong> "Fight for the things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you."</strong></p>
            <p> <strong> "A gebder line ... helps to keep women not on a pedestal, but in a cage."</strong></p>
            <p> <strong> "Don't be distracted by emotions like anger, envy, resentment. These just zap energy and waste time."</strong></p>
            <p> <strong> "If you have a caring life partner, you help the other person when that person needs it. I have a life partner who thought my work was as important as his, and that made all the difference for me."</strong></p>
            <p> <strong> "I would like to be remembered as someone who used whatever talent she had to do her work to the very best of her ability."</strong></p>
