            <li>As the climate continues to change, millions of poor people face greater challenges in terms of extreme events, health effects, food security, livelihood security, migration, water security, cultural identity, and other related risks.</li>
            <li>In the absence of well-designed and inclusive policies, climate change mitigation measures can place a higher financial burden on poor households.</li>
            <li>For example, policies that expand public transport or carbon pricing may lead to higher public transport fares  which can impact poorer households more.</li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
            <li>Climate change is deeply intertwined with global patterns of inequality.</li>
            <li>The most vulnerable people bear the brunt of climate change impacts yet contribute the least to the crisis.</li>
            <li>As the impacts of climate change mount, millions of vulnerable people face greater challenges in terms of extreme events, health effects, food security, livelihood security, water security, and cultural identity.</li>

            <li><strong>climate change on economy</strong></li>
            <li>Data showed that economies in South and South-east Asia were the most susceptible to the physical risks associated with global warming.</li>
            <li>Countries most negatively impacted – including Malaysia, Thailand, India, the Philippines and Indonesia – were often the ones with the least resources to mitigate and adapt to the effects of global warming.</li>
            <li>However, such nations also have the most to gain from global efforts to reduce temperature rises, the report added.</li>

            <li>Research has shown repeatedly that warmer temperatures and more extreme weather contribute to a slew of adverse outcomes: violent crime, political instability and the collapse of regimes, to name a few.</li>
            <li>This year is likely to be the first- or second-hottest year on record, and extreme weather and climate-related events have struck from coast to coast in the U.S.</li>
            <li>For years, many politicians and commentators shuddered when scientists or climate activists discussed climate change in relation to individual storms or wildfires, accusing them of politicizing disaster—and, in those cases, the link to climate change was relatively straightforward.</li>
            <li>The evidence connecting climate change and political stability has been less obvious, but is becoming increasingly impossible to ignore.</li>
