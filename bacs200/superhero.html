            <p>Marvel has alluded to Carol being weak against magic before, but the panel confirms it's one of her greatest weaknesses. </p>
            <p>It means Captain Marvel and Superman, two of the most powerful heroes in their respective universes who are practically invulnerable, are susceptible to being defeated by magic.</p>
